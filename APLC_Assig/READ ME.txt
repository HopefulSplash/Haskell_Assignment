Follow the directions below to finding the files containing both the Haskell and Java solution

Haskell Implementation -> APLC_TSP.Hs
Java Implementations -> APLC_TSP.Java -> src -> APLC_TSP_JAVA_SOLUTION

To run the haskell solutions load them in GCHi and then type result to produce and answer in all 3 solutions

Brute_Force_Algorithm_TSP.hs ------> type "result" once loaded
Nearest_Neighbour_Algorithm_TSP.hs ------> type "result" once loaded
Repetitive_Nearest_Neighbour_Algorithm_TSP ------> type "result" once loaded

To run the java open an IDE and open the project as a whole not the individual files and run them
